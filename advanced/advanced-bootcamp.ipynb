    "## Review\n",
    "What did we learn in the first python bootcamp? If you want to go check it out in depth, it is available on my github here https://github.com/cagostino/python-bootcamp/blob/master/beginner/pybootcamp.ipynb . If not, we'll go over the basics here. We learned how to use python as a calculator and all of the mathematical symbols\n",
    "$$ +,/,*,-,//,%$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We also learned how to assign variables and about different data types. The main datatypes we used then and will use today were integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, Booleans. We also learned about the methods and properties that come with each of these data types. We learned about array indexing, how to import libraries, and how to write our own functions. We learned how to loop and how to control the flow of the program with conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To jog our python memory and to get the creative juices flowing, we're going to start off with an exercise on finding peaks in a neon spectrum to go over loops, conditionals, writing functions, and plotting, \n",
    "### Exercise 0\n",
    "First, import matplotlib.pyplot as plt and numpy as np.\n",
    "For this exercise, load in a file called 'neon.txt' using np.loadtxt.\n",
    "Transpose the data you just loaded in so it is the right format. Write a function which takes in two arrays, a pixel array and a signal array, and loops over the two to determine the peak locations in the spectrum (in the signal array). This function should return an array of peak positions In this for loop, create a suitable criteria for determining whether or not a peak is actually peak. Python's all function should be helpful in doing this. Include some sort of arbitrary threshold to ignore some insignificant peaks. \n",
    "Then write a function to plot the spectrum using matplotlib.pyplot. In that function, plot the vertical lines where each of the peaks occur with plt.axvline(x=peak , ls=':')  "

    "## Overview\n",
    "Today, we're going to have a brief overview of dictionaries then will learn more about classes and object oriented programming. Using this, we will develop a simulation of the solar system.\n",
    "We will then learn how to parallelize our code to take advantage of the ability of our computers to process multiple calculations at the same time. We will then learn about Markov methods and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and use a model to fit Earth's ice core temperatures as a function of time. \n",
    "After that, we will look at how to scrape webpges in Python and then finally how to make graphical user interfaces.\n",

    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "In python, dictionaries are series of key-values pairs. They are  useful for storing values with specific key names, usually with text information These are enclosed in braces.  \n",
    "For example, if you were writing a program that turned your keyboard into a virtual piano and you wanted to have keys corresponding to different piano notes you could use a dictionary."

    "### Classes\n",
    "Python is an object oriented programming language. The different datatypes we have already encountered were different classes in python. As we could develop our own variables and functions, we too can develop our own classes. In these classes there will be attributes (class specific variables) and methods (class specific functions).\n",
    "#### Attributes\n",
    "In python there are class attributes and instance attributes available through dot notation. Class attributes will be the same for all instances of the class regardless of the parameters of the instance. Instance variables will likely be different from instance to instance and are initialized with the \\__init\\__ function.\n",
    "##### Methods\n",
    "Methods are functions available through dot notation. We used many of these when working with strings, lists, and numpy arrays like  str.upper() and list.append().\n",
    "##### Subclasses and inheritance \n",
    "Sometimes it's helpful to define a subclass to do more specific things.  For example, you might have a pet class with different subclasses for dogs, cats, hamsters etc. to have attributes more specific to each pet.\n",
    "##### Some More Resources \n",
    "Chapters 12-14 of this book\n",
    "http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cash register example\n",
    "Here we set up a cash register to show how classes are initialized with \\__init\\__ and how to set up instance attributes, methods, and the importance of self. "

For its  initial parameters, include the self argument as well as an average speed argument and an initial X position (in miles) which is automatically assumed to be 0 (hint: look at the Register class for how to do this!), and a direction which should be automatically assumed to be forward. To set the direction to be forwards/backwards it might be good to use 1 for forwards and -1 for backwards.\n",

    "### Simulations\n",
    "Simulations attempt to tell us how a system changes over time or with respect to some other parameter. The quality of the simulation usually depends on the resolution of the time step. If your time step is too large, it is possible you may miss out on some important information. If it is too small, it might take too long to run. Though the underlying processes will differ in simulations, the basic idea is that you are trying to model complex system which can not be analytically solved. Perhaps the simplest example of this is the three-body problem in physics. In this next exercise, you will be taking a set of multiple masses and seeing how they move due to gravity over time. "

    "The gravitational force between two bodies m_1 an m_2 separated by a distance r is defined as \n",

    "To simulate the effects of gravity on multiple bodies, we can use classes! We want to develop a class of generalized bodies which obey gravity. We want to make a class with all of the necessary parameters. For this project, we are going to work in two dimensions, though it is quite easy to generalize to a third dimension.\n",
    "##### Classes\n",
    "1. To do this, create a body class which requires a mass, position (x and y) and velocity (x and y) as its initialization parameters. \n",
    "2. In addition to these initial parameters in your \\__init\\__ function, set up two empty arrays for x position and y position so that as the simulation progresses we can keep track of how the body moved.\n",
    "3. Create a gravity method which finds the force between the two objects. Then find a way to convert that total force into its x and y components and return those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Simulating Gravity\n",
    "1. Begin by defining a simulate function which takes in a list of bodies.\n",
    "2. Define your timestep (in seconds). In my implementation I use one day but test some values out. You will also want to set a number of steps. A good number would be on the order of a hundred days so you can see some sort of larger structure to the orbits.\n",
    "3. Create a for or while loop which will loop the number of steps you want.\n",
    "4. In this while/for loop, Create two empty arrays, one for force in the x direction and one for force in the y direction.\n",
    "5. Then, inside of the loop, create another for loop which loops over the different bodies. Inside of that loop, make two variables, totalfx,totalfy, and set them equal to zero. We will be adding to these when we measure gravity.\n",
    "6. In that loop, create another for loop that loops over the different bodies. Inside of this loop, check to make sure that the two bodies are not the same body. If they are indeed different, use the gravity method to find the force between the two bodies. Add the values from the gravity function to the totalfx and totalfy variables from the previous step.\n",
    "7. Outside of that loop, append the totalfx and totalfy to the arrays defined in step 4.\n",
    "8. Now we have all of the forces on all of the bodies. In the while/for loop, create another for loop which we can use to extract the information from the force and bodies array.\n",
    "9. In this for loop, use the information from the force array and the mass of the body to determine the accelerations in the x and y directions. Then use that and the timestep to change the velocity.\n",
    "10. With the new velocity, adjust the new x and y positions and these values to our empty position arrays that we defined in the body method.\n",
    "11. Now we’re done with all of actual computation! Now we simply need to show our results. Use another for loop (outside of the while/for loop) to plot the position arrays we set up before. \n"

The area of the square will be its side length (2R)^2. The ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square wil be pi/4. We can use this to estimate the value of pi. If we randomly pick points within this space, we can assume that the probability of randomly picking a point within the circle is proportional to the area of the circle. Using this, if we determine the ratio of the points inside the circle to the total number of points, we can approximate a value for pi.\n",

    "According to wikipedia, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are a class of algorithms for sampling from a probability distribution based on constructing a Markov Chain.\n",
    "MCMC, as it is colloquially called, is incredibly useful for fitting with large parameter spaces which are much harder to fit with analytic methods. These parameter spaces are often highly degenerate and, as a result, will often fool many other fitting techniques into local minima and maxima rather than the global ones. With MCMC, we can effectively determine the likelihood of certain parameter combinations by sampling different regions of the parameter space. \n",
    "One example is from my own research, where I use spot models to try to replicate stellar light curves. Each spot has a size, latitude, longitude, and rotation period. We use MCMC to find the best fitting parameters for combinations of 4 or more spots. The spot map below (courtesy of my advisor Prof. Gibor Basri),  shows how the light output of a star is decreased as a result of these spots being present.\n",

There are three processes that affect the Earth's temperature on three different timescales. These occur on timescales of 26000 , 41000 and 100000 years so we use those as our initial period guesses. These initial guesses are in par0,par1, and par2. We have to also include minimum and maximum values to limit the MCMC from investigating unrealistic or unallowed values. This is what these for loops are doing and pardict contains the limits for these values. Finally we add in the initial Temperature value T0."
