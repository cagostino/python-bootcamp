    "The gravitational force between two bodies m_1 an m_2 separated by a distance r is defined as \n",
    "$$F_{g} = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $$\n",
    "where G is the gravitational constant, 6.67e-11. In addition, we know from Newton's second law that\n",
    "$$F=ma$$\n",
    "and that if acceleration is constant (which we can assume it is over short time intervals), the velocity of the object is then \n",
    "$$v=at$$\n",
    "where t is our timestep and a is determined from our force equation.\n",
    "We can find our position as a function of time in this linear regime as being\n",
    "$$x=vt$$\n",
    "A nontrivial fact about the graviational force is that it obeys the law of superpostion, meaning that the total force on any object is just the sum of all of the individual forces on that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate the effects of gravity on multiple bodies, we can use classes! We want to develop a class of generalized bodies which obey gravity. We want to make a class with all of the necessary parameters. For this project, we are going to work in two dimensions, though it is quite easy to generalize to a third dimension.\n",
    "##### Classes\n",
    "1. To do this, create a body class which requires a mass, position (x and y) and velocity (x and y) as its initialization parameters. \n",
    "2. In addition to these initial parameters in your __init__ function, set up two empty arrays for x position and y position so that as the simulation progresses we can keep track of how the body moved.\n",
    "3. Create a gravity method which finds the force between the two objects. Then find a way to convert that total force into its x and y components and return those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Simulating Gravity\n",
    "1. Begin by defining a simulate function which takes in a list of bodies.\n",
    "2. Define your timestep (in seconds). In my implementation I use one day but test some values out. You will also want to set a number of steps. A good number would be on the order of a hundred days so you can see some sort of larger structure to the orbits.\n",
    "3. Create a for or while loop which will loop the number of steps you want.\n",
    "4. In this while/for loop, Create two empty arrays, one for force in the x direction and one for force in the y direction.\n",
    "5. Then, inside of the loop, create another for loop which loops over the different bodies. Inside of that loop, make two variables, totalfx,totalfy, and set them equal to zero. We will be adding to these when we measure gravity.\n",
    "6. In that loop, create another for loop that loops over the different bodies. Inside of this loop, check to make sure that the two bodies are not the same body. If they are indeed different, use the gravity method to find the force between the two bodies. Add the values from the gravity function to the totalfx and totalfy variables from the previous step.\n",
    "7. Outside of that loop, append the totalfx and totalfy to the arrays defined in step 4.\n",
    "8. Now we have all of the forces on all of the bodies. In the while/for loop, create another for loop which we can use to extract the information from the force and bodies array.\n",
    "9. In this for loop, use the information from the force array and the mass of the body to determine the accelerations in the x and y directions. Then use that and the timestep to change the velocity.\n",
    "10. With the new velocity, adjust the new x and y positions and these values to our empty position arrays that we defined in the body method.\n",
    "11. Now weâ€™re done with all of actual computation! Now we simply need to show our results. Use another for loop (outside of the while/for loop) to plot the position arrays we set up before. \n"
