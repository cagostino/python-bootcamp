<h4>This is a python bootcamp in the form of a Jupyter Notebook intended for those who wish to have a basic introduction to python. It is geared more towards the practicality of python as a scientific and data analysis tool. </h4>

Written with Python3. Requires numpy, matplotlib, scikit-image and PIL

This has been developed to serve the CalNERDS community at UC-Berkeley. Special thanks goes to Imad Pasha as much of the material in this bootcamp stems from that which we have taught in the Python for Astronomy Decal. Please check it out <a href='http://ugastro.berkeley.edu/pydecal'>here</a>.
In addition, special thanks to Alex Nguyen for suggestions and critiques.
